This project focuses on migrating the existing MATLAB-based Cardiac Timing Toolbox 
(CaTT) to Python and building on the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) to create an 
advanced data-driven tool for studying the relationship between cardiac timing and human behavior. 
Analytics platform. CaTT is a powerful tool that aligns behavioral data to specific phases of the 
cardiac cycle (R-peak or T-wave peak), allowing researchers to study the temporal relationship 
between cardiac activity and behavior. By calculating z-values and p-values, CaTT quantifies the 
statistical significance and concentration of behavioral distributions, providing a more intuitive 
understanding.
